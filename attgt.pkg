d ATTGT - Average Treatment Effects with Staggered Treatment

d `att` computes average treatment effect parameters in Difference in Differences setups with more than two periods and with variation in treatment timing using the methods developed in Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021) <doi:10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.12.001>. The main parameters are group-time average treatment effects which are the average treatment effect for a particular group at a particular time. These can be aggregated into a fewer number of treatment effect parameters, and the package deals with the cases where there is selective treatment timing, dynamic treatment effects, calendar time effects, or combinations of these.
